# DIVINE EFFORT
DIVINE EFFORT operates similar to the MAGIC EFFORT in the base Index Card RPG with a few modification. DIVINE EFFORT is the catch-all move for when you want to invoke you DIVINE powers in some fashion, be it: Freeze a pond, call a lightning strike,or grow a flower in seconds. 

To make a DIVINE EFFORT attempt, roll an ATTEMPT(1d20) + ASCENDANCY. ASCENDANCY is the modifier given to you as you level up your PANTHEON, typically it is given even PANTHEON level. The target DC will be determined by the GM and is dependent on the situation.

The damage that is done by a DIVINE EFFORT is a DIVINE(1d8) unless modified. Duration of DIVINE EFFORT may be a set number of rounds or DIVINE, this will determined by the GM prior to rolling.

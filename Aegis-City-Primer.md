This is Aegis, the city in the mist. Used to be that the mist was from the bay, now its just smoke from the factories.. The city has a reputation for being the economic center of the provinces, all the major corporations have headquarters here. All the newsverts and casts you see of the city are inside the corporate campuses, artificial paradises to entice investors and vacationers.

There are 5 major corporations in the city center. These are the ones that have been here since the begin, the ones that run the city. These corporations are:
*  The first the *Cernun Corporation*, located in the CBD(Central Business District). Money, money, money, they own casinos, arenas, for profit prisons, they give out loans to those who cant pay them and thrive of slowly bleeding the money out of society. If you get in early though and you play your cards right you can pull yourself and friends and family up out of the squalor by working for them.
*  *The Eternal: Ilm* is the defacto owners of The Grid. They run the schools, training academies, science labs and all the "smart" stuff. Didn't start that way though, originally they were a mercenary company that invested heavily into R&D. Eventually they decided to build good will by investing in schools, and now they own most of them.
*  *UzyKorp* A European company that got it's start in mining and shipping. Built a entire operation center in the industrial zone. Waste disposal, shipping, manufacturing, sales, everything they have the whole thing locked down. Uzykorp tends to make a bit of everything and the stuff the build lasts a long time. Recently they've been giving *Ilm* a run for their money in the military field.
*  *The Collective* don't even try to hide their influence on Downtown. Their whole shtick is ancient Greece and they push that aesthetic onto everything. The redlight district, the fighting pits, the raceways, everything, the vacationers love it but god damn it's annoying. They also got their hands into cybertek somehow, opened up Wyvern and now pump out top of the line gear. 
*  Finally Dracogenics HQ, less of a corporation and more of a collective consciousness of the smaller corporations. It's the only way they haven't been bought out and crushed, they got themselves voted in as the "unbiased" governing body of the city.

# Starter Loot


## Choose Your Gear:
As part of creating your HERO, select equipment that fits your
story, matches your fighting style, or emphasizes your STAT,
ARMOR (+10 ARMOR is the maximum that can be worn), and
EFFORT choices.

Choose wisely! These choices will cement the idea you had for
your HERO at the beginning, and LOOT is not easy to come by,
depending on your GM and your luck.

Each Character Sheet includes a section for Starter Loot and
Starting Equipment.
